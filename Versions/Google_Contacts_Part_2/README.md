# Contact Manager for Google Contacts

## Project Overview

The Contact Manager for Google Contacts is an application designed to simplify the management and import of contacts into Google Contacts. In Part 2 of the project, several visual improvements were implemented to enhance the user experience, and directory structure refinements were made to better facilitate project changes and adhere to Flask project best practices.

## Visual Enhancements

### Contact Form

The contact form has undergone visual improvements to make the user interface more intuitive and aesthetically pleasing. The changes aim to create a seamless experience for users when entering contact details.

### Message Display

A new feature has been added to display messages at the top of the page, providing users with real-time feedback on the success or failure of their actions.

## Project Structure Refinement

To follow Flask project best practices and enhance maintainability, the project's directory structure has been reorganized. Changes were made to improve code organization and facilitate future modifications. Key changes include:

- **Separation of Responsibilities**: Code related to contact handling and integration with Google Contacts is organized into separate modules, promoting modularity and readability.

- **Static and Template Directories**: Static assets (CSS, JavaScript) and HTML templates are now stored in dedicated directories for clarity and organization.

- **Centralized Configuration**: Settings such as file paths and API credentials are centrally managed for ease of maintenance.
