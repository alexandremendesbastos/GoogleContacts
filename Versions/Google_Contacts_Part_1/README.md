# Project Description: Contact Manager for Google Contacts

This project aims to facilitate the efficient addition of bulk contacts to the Google Contacts cloud. Currently, the first part of the project allows the creation and manipulation of a local CSV file containing contact information. This CSV file can then be imported into Google Contacts, simplifying the process of adding multiple contacts.

## Current Features

1. **Contact Form:** An intuitive form is provided for users to enter contact details, including name, email, and phone number, into a local CSV file.

2. **Local Storage:** Data provided by users is stored locally in a CSV file. The system keeps an efficient track of the contacts added.

## Future Features (Planned)

1. **Automatic Upload to Google Contacts:** Implementation of the functionality to automatically upload contacts from the local CSV file to Google Contacts, further simplifying the process.

2. **Visual Enhancement:** Visual improvements to the user interface to provide a more pleasant and user-friendly experience.

## Importing CSV Data into Google Contacts

1. **CSV File Preparation:** The user creates a local CSV file containing the contact details, following the standard format provided in the form.

2. **Login to Google Contacts:** The user logs into the Google account associated with the contacts.

3. **Accessing the Import Interface:** In the Google Contacts interface, the user selects the import option and chooses the locally stored CSV file.

4. **Mapping Fields:** The system asks the user to map the fields in the CSV file with the corresponding fields in Google Contacts (name, email, phone, etc.).

5. **Import Completion:** After confirmation, Google Contacts processes and imports the contacts from the CSV file into the associated account.

With these features, the project aims to simplify and speed up the process of managing contacts on a large scale, making it accessible to intermediate technology users.
